# filesay

Simple program to create !filesay ban commands for fossabot to efficiently ban follow bots.
Just drag and drop the csv file generated at https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/followerlist_viewer.php into a folder with the python file. The program will automatically search for the first csv file on it's own.
You can also use the executable for Windows or create your own executable for your own operating system using tools like auto-py-to-exe or py2exe.
